# SkimLit: A Deep Learning Project for Classifying Abstracts
## Overview
SkimLit is a deep learning-based project designed to automate the classification of biomedical research abstracts into predefined categories. This system helps researchers and practitioners skim through scientific papers quickly by summarizing key information from abstracts.

Inspired by the PubMed 200k RCT Dataset, this project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify abstracts into sections such as objectives, methods, results, and conclusions.

## Features
**Abstract Classification**: Categorizes text into relevant sections of research papers.

**Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, and embedding using state-of-the-art methods.

**Visualization**: Provides easy-to-read summaries of abstract sections.

**Customizable Pipeline**: Adaptable for other datasets or domains beyond biomedical research.
## Technology used 

**Frameworks**: TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning)

**Libraries**: NumPy and Pandas (Data manipulation)

**Dataset**: PubMed 200k RCT Dataset: Link
